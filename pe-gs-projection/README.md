This sample was featured in [this blog post](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2017/10/27/creating-a-custom-tile-layer-with-typescript/) introducing the client-side projection engine.

This sample demonstrates how to use the client-side projection engine in JavaScript application. It also compares the performance of client-side projection versus the geometryserver projection.
